This repository demonstrates a common PHP bug involving unexpected 0 returns due to loose type comparisons in arithmetic operations.  The `bug.php` file contains the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.php` provides the corrected version.  The issue arises when using loose comparisons (==) with 0 in conditional statements which may lead to unexpected results when dealing with both numeric and string inputs.
